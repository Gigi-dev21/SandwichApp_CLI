  <h1>DELI-cious Application</h1>
  <p>
    This project is a digital Point of Sales (POS) system for <strong>DELI-cious</strong>, a custom sandwich shop.
    The goal is to replace the current paper-based order system with a simple and fast computer program.
  </p>
  <p>
    The system will allow customers to <strong>build their own sandwiches</strong> and help staff manage orders more easily.
    It is designed using <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong>, with the use of classes and interfaces.
  </p>
<h2>Class Diagram</h2>
  <p>Here is the class diagram for the system:</p>
